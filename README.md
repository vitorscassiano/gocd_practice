#### Simple project that provides a single GoCD Server and so many GoCd Agents.

#### Requirements:
* Vagrant (It is simple with `gem install vagrant`, in case use: www.vagrantup.com)
* Ansible (It is simple with `pip install ansible`, in other case use: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)


#### Quickstart
```shell
> vagrant up  # This command will up and provision all vagrant machines with GoCD Server and GoCD Agents.
```

Thanks all!
